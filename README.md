# Lanark

![Lanark](playground/resources/lanark-60x2.png)

Kotlin multiplatform framework for simple games and media applications. 
Primitive. Really it is. Not ready. Like at all. Seriously, it's a draft.  


## Roadmap

* Improve overall architecture by integrating things from experiments, and doing more experiments
* Improve desktop vs mobile experience (cursors vs touch, screen measures and rotations, windowed and full screen)
* Replace custom event loop with coroutines
* Implement UI part to the point of being usable for simple dialogs like start menu, high scores, etc
* Implement few simple 2D games
  * 2D shooter, something like Konami Knightmare :)
  * 2D platformer
  * (in 2 years) an RPG
  
â€¦

* Profit!
